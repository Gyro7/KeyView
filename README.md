# KeyView
KeyView is a really small side-project I created in September after starting school, because I was kinda bored...Anyway, KeyView is a classic keyboard viewer for streamers and gamers to use in streamings!   
## How to use it
Just start the main.go file (you must have Go installed and also the library I used: <a href="https://ebiten.org">Ebiten)</a> or, simply, start the .exe file, then go to your streaming program (example OBS Studio or Streamlabs...), choose KeyView and add it as a scene.
## First release
The first release is a bit raw because it just shows what keys you are clicking (basically that's the main goal of the program)  
You can find the .exe file in <a href="https://github.com/Gyro7/KeyView/releases/">Releases</a>
### It's not a KeyLogger!
I saw a lot of friends misunderstanding it for a Keylogger, which is not, because a keylogger is a malware used by hackers that tracks the keys you click to get your information (passwords, etc.)
